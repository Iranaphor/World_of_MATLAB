# Documentation Rules
Aim to keep one function/class per file. Whilst this does increase number of
files to manage, it should make things simpler down the line and keep code 
clean.

Functions Docs should use standard MATLAB syntax, then include the function
author and version/since tags and finally a list of input parameters and 
output parameters in javadocs style.
